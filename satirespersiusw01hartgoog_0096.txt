51. Nonadao, r’nqais,·] These words are spoken by the heir ; and
so, I suppose, are those which follow: ‘Exossatus ager juxta est.¹
But it is impossible to say what the passage means. The simplest
explanation seems to be, that the heir declines to have any thing to
(lo with a property which is so nearly wastetl, and that then the poet
says that he can find another heir somewhere. ‘I won't go near it;
your land is pretty nearly exlrausted.’ lt hardly seems necessary to
mention the other explanatione which have been suggested.

52. si mihi oolla] 'l'here is no mention ol any male relatives, because
plre'property could descend to women only in case there were no male

errs.

5⁵. accedo Bovillas] Bovillae was on tbe Appian Way, between
Rome aad Aricia. 'l‘be ‘clivus Virbi' was the ‘clivus Aricinus,'
about four miles from Bovillae aad sixteen from llome. It wasa

well-known station for beggars (see Juv. iv. 117). Virbius, from
whom the hill was named, was the Italian Hippolytus. ‘Multi
Manli Ariciae' was a proverb, but its meaning is doubtful; perhaps
they were the descendants of the old aristocrncy who batl become
beggissroqenics terrac !] This is the exclamation of the heir, express·

ing surprise that the poet should be willing to leave bis property to
a person whose parents are unknown, a mere ‘terrae filius' (γηγενὴς,
‘gigas' Juv. iv. 93). The poet replies that he himself would lind
trouble in telling the name of his great-great-grantllhtlrer (‘ abavus Ἲς
and, as to bis ‘atavus' or ot least his ‘tritavus’ nobody knows who
he was; he was a ‘son of earth' and therefore a brother of Manius,
who appears by regular descent t‘ ritu generis ') to be a sort of great·
great-uncle of the poet's. ‘Major avunculus' is properly one’s grand·
fatber's uncle on the great-grandmother's side, and ‘maximus avun-
culus' is one degree further back. Juvenal seems to have borrowed
the idea of this passage in viii. ala-ara.

61. eripriores,] Persius means to reprove his heir for his greed,
‘ and to bid him consider what may be leh bim as a free gift, notas a
debt. The reference bere is to the torch-raee (λαμπαδηφορὶα), the
chief feature of which was the passing of a lighted torah from hand
to band, each runner being carei’ul not to extinguish tbe flame before
he handcd the torah to the runner who was before him. The poet
seems to inquire of his heir, who is running before him, why be asks
for the torcb anti is not willing to walt till he is ready to give it to
him. He changes-the figure in the next verse, and tells him that he
is like blercury in the picturas offering a bag of money to people;
and he implies that a wisc man will take the money without counting
it or asking questions. ‘Vin' tu' is the form of the simple interroga·
tive while ‘vis tu' is rather equivalcnt to ‘nonne vis,' conveying an
idea of command and reproof: ‘Will you be so good as to take what
Ileave and be tlranklul i' (See Hor. S. ii. 6. 92; Juv. v. 74.)

64. Deest alr'qaid attractae] ‘Suppose part oi my fortune is gone,
that is my lookout; you have all that is left! ‘Deest' is to be pro·
