black secretion of the cuttle-lish, which the Romans sometimes used
forink.

15. Omissa] The poet upbraitls the young man, and advises him
ironically to act in every thing like a pet dove or a rich man's baby,
and call lor pap and reluse to listen to a lullaby. ‘Pappara’ ‘mam--
ma,’ and ‘lallare' are uursery words ; the infinitives are used here as
nouus in the accusative.

19. Aa tali studeam] This is the youth's deleme, to which the poet .
replics. ‘Das’ may be supplied to govern ‘verba ’: ‘Whom are you
tryiug to deceive? why do you give that evasive ansivari your own
interests are at stake; you are t'oolishly letting yourself run to waste;
you will only be despised; the unbaked vessel oi green clay rings
tlawed when oue strikes it, and gives back a dead sound. In fact,
you had better be made over anevv on the wlreel! ‘Vitium' is an
accusative of kindred signification, as if it were ‘sonum vitiosum)

s ‘Viridis' is used like χλωρός, in the sense of ‘crudus’

24. Sed rare palare] The poet takes these words out ol the youth's
mouth, as heis attempting to excuse himself lor his neglect ol study.
He is made to say that lre is moderately well off, with a bit of grain·
bearing laud (‘far'), and a piece ol plats, which perhaps be calls
‘spotless' to show that the heir-loom has come down to himin a re-
spectable line and is kept without a blot. The ‘patella’ ol which he
goes on to speak was probably the dish in which a part of the leod at
each meal was offered to the Lares. ‘Secura' seems to imply that
there was always enough to cat ; aud the dish is called ‘cultrix foci'
because it stood near the lire, or because its coutents were thrown into
it; so that we may render the words either ‘dweller on' or ⁴ worship·

‘Pulmonem rumpere ventis' is ‘to pust yoursell up.' ‘Stemma'
properly the garland hung on the ‘imagines' (whence the use ol ‘ra

Juvenal viii. l). The Etruscan stock was especially honorable, like
that ol Maecenas or of Persius himself. ‘Millesime' stands rhetori·
cally in the vocative, instead ol' agreciug with ‘ramum' or with the
subiect of the vcrb; compare i. 123, and note. The figure ol syntax

29. Censoremoe tuam] The text and the meaning are both doubtful.
The tautology in ‘ve . . . vel' is apparently uncxamplcrl, but it is better
than ‘ue . . . vel' which is read in somemanuscripts. The usual render-
ing is: ‘because (on review days) you put on purple ‘and salute your
