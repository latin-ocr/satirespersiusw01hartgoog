140. Jom pueris pellem succinctus] Avaritia ends her speech at
‘tendis' Then the man is supposed to be in a hurry to obey her;

149. qaos lu'c quincunce rrrodesto] The legal interest was twelve per
cent. per annum. Five per cent. therefore was moderate interest; but
it is better, Soli-indulgence says, than a greedy eleven per cent. got
