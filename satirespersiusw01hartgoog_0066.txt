sarran 11. 47

an idea that the divinities value geldas highly as they themselves do,
and so attempt to please thern by gilding their images. ‘Crateras'
is from ‘cratera’ ‘lncusa auro' is ‘overlaid with gold '; that is, with
‘emblemata' enrbossed ornaments which were t'astcned in some way
to the vessel which they were intended to adoru; so that ‘crateras
—dona' is very probably a hendiadys. ‘Pectore laevo’ is simply nn
allusion to the position of the beart (011111. vii. lab). ‘Laetari' de·
penda 011 ‘praetrepidum': ‘overhasty to rejoice,' ‘in a liutter ot' joy ’;
the construction hasbeen noticed on Prol. ll and elsewhere.

· 55. Hinc iliad subiit] ‘ Hence has it come,’ because the man thinks
that the gods are like himself in love 01 gold. For the construe-
tion see M. 398, b, and obs.1; A. 11),1); G. 525. The final vowel in
‘subiit’ ‘adiit’ etc, is frequently lengthened in arsis. ‘Auro ovato'
is goldlthat bas been taken in war and paraded in the conqueror’s
trium 1.

. 56.pNom fratres inter ahenos] ‘Nam' introduces aa illustration:
‘For instance, you must give the preference to those gods who send
good dreams, so gild their beards for thena’ 'l'he ‘bronze brothers'
probably means all the gods who had bronze statues; but it is a euri·
ous expression. ‘Pituita purgatissima’ means ‘most free from the
disturbances 01 a disordered stomach '; ‘pituita' must be pronounced
in three syllables.

⁵9. Aaron oasa Numae) From this he goes ou to complain that
gold hasbeen introduce into the temple worship, and bas pushed
out theold vessels 01 bronze and clay. Numa is mentioned as being
the founder oi the religious system ol' the itomans3 and Saturn, prob-
ably as the most ancient of the gods. 'l'be worship of the Vestals
was offered in the old style, with rude eartbenware vessels such
as were used in the Etruscan rites. Verses 1190111160 seem eachto
contain a hendiadys.

63. Quidjarat hoe] ‘What is the good of introducing our way 01
living into the temples, and 01 inferring 110111 11110 wicked iieslr of ours
what is acceptabis to the godst’ ‘Pulpa,' which strictly rueans the
solid flesb as opposed to the bones, is here applied, almost in the New
Το010111011100110001011ρξ (e. g. τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς, ltom. viii. 6, 7) 10
1110 “ carnal m'an,'’ the vicinus desires and evil nature of our raee.

64. Haec sibi corrupto] Now follow some practical illustratione of
the working of the ‘pulpa' in man, as it teaches him to gratity his
wishes in different ways. It puts 01101 cassia into olive-oil to indulge
itsell (‘sibi'), but so as to spoil the good oil (‘ corrupto’ is here pro·
leptic); it dyes tlte fine wool ol' Calabria with purple which it changes
from its proper use (‘ vitiato ’t ; it teaches us 1ο serape the pearl from
its slrell, and to tear the veins 01 molten ore froin tbeir native earth.
The verbs may be translated either as aorists or as perfects.

68. Pereat et 1100] The flesh errabat it makes something by it:
11 enjoys the luxuries which it discovers3 it bas sorno excuse. But
there' is no excuse 101 gold in sacred places: the gods have not the
sante desires which we have; ‘quid t'acitl’ ‘what business has it
there t' As much, he answers, as the dolls which 1110 girls at the end
01 their clrildhood offer to Venus.
