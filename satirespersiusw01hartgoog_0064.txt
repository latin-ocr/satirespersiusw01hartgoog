sarran 11. 45

the ‘proximus heres' who will get the property in case the boy dies;
and he justifies his prayer as well as his hopes by saying that the
youth is scrofulous and bilious, implying that death would be a great
blessing ιο him.

14. Nerio jamenta] llerethe discontented man complains of his lot,
and gives a broad hint to the gods, implying that he has been married
but once, and so has gotten but a chance of one dowry‚ while a more
fortunate friend is actually burying his third wife. The ‘dos' seems
ιο bave come to the husband at the death of the wife. For ‘conditur,'
some read ‘ducitun’ which implies the death of but two wives.

15. Haec sancte at poscas] ιΤο make sure that you offer such pray-
ers as these religiously.' lt seems to bave been a common penance
or act of devotion to stand or to plunge one's aelf in the ‘fiber (see
Hor. S. ii. 3. 290; Juv. vi. 523). ‘Bis terque' is ‘again and again' ;
‘ noctem' means the moral pollution of thenight's debauchery.

1⁷. Heus apa] Persius addresses one of the men who oller such
prayers as he has just recited, and asks bim what opinion he has of
Jove that he dares to suggest such ideas to him, and whether there
happens to be anyhody whom hs would treet with less respect.
The man suggesting that he should mention some articular person,
he names Staius, who is said to he the Staienus of icero Pro Cluen·
tio ; and, in answer ιο some apparent hesitation (ί an scilicet haeres? '),
he aske him which of the two, Jupiter or Staius, lie would rather have
ιο decide a case in court, or to take the care of fatherless children.
Theman decides that Jupiter is the more respectable character; and
Persius then bide him imagine himself making such propositione to
Staius as he makes to the god. Staius would cry out in horror, “0
gracious Jupiterl’' ‘Don't you suppose that Jupiter is as much
shocked, and even cries out ¹¹ 0 J upiterl'’ himself ι’ This interpreta-
tion of verse 20 seems ιο me decidedly the best; and I suppose ‘quis'
ιο be used for ‘uter,' as it certainly is in Juvenal viii. leo (Ι can find
no reference ιο this in the grammate), and as m hnglrsh whieh' has
taken the place of ‘whether’ (of the two). For the use ol ¹ ut’ (verse
18) see A. 70, 4,a; G. bb& H. 495, 2.

24. ocius ilex Salsum discutitur] This is the standard argument of
the skeptic (see Jur. xiii), but Persius refuses to admit it; he says
that Jupiter will endure a good deal, but it is not safe ιο pull hie heard
or to try ιο buy his favor with the worthless parts of a sacrifice. A

rites being all of Etruscan origin.

29. quidnam cst qna tu mercede] This seems a double question by
esort of zeugma: ‘ What is it that you wish to buy of the gods, and
