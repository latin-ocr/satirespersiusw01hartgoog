up his yoke at the worn orossroads,’ seems to refer to some occasion
on which sarmers dedicated their yokes to the Lares Compitales, and
were expected to give a feast to their households. It is impossible
to tell exactly what is meant. ‘Quandoque' is for ‘quandocunque'
as twice in Horace. ‘lldc bene sit l' was a common l'orm of prayer,
especially when there was any thing doubtful about the matter in
hand. This stingy man groans it out, as he dreads to disturh the
duston his little jar oi wine. ‘Tunicatum caepc' isan onion caten
with the skin on so that there need he no waste. ‘Farratam ollam’
is a dish of ‘puls’ which ordinary laborers had every day, but which
was such a treat to this man’s slaves (‘ pueri ’J that they clapped their
hands when it was given to them. The wine avias not very good which

to have been the place where money-lenders carried on their business.
To whip the puteal severely nray mean to overreach the people who
came there to horrow money ; but it is impossible to tell. ‘Bibulas
aures’ are ‘cars that drink in flattery.' lle ends with a fino seuti-
ment: ‘Let common people (cobblcrs, duv. iv. 153) carry off their
