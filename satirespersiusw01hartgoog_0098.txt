sonno vr. 79

ono will come oster you to wake you up ond ask you the sarno ques-
tion.’' Persius seems to say that the man who wishes a iimit set to
his aranee oonhl tell Chrysippus when he hod o heop and so solve
the ‘sorites' There is also a logical term ‘sorites' which means o
series of propositions depending esch upon thc one before it until a
conclusion is reached which connects the flrst proposition with tho
iast3 but the reference here seems to me to bc without doubt to the
fallacy which has boen just described.
