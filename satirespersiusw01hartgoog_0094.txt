which he nray get a little 01 11; aad, that the precious pepper may
not be wasted, he sprinkles it himself upon his plata. ‘Tingat ' and
‘irrorat' both add to the picture of his parsimony. ‘Magnanimus’
is used ironically to express the opposite to all this. ‘ Grandia pera·
gere ' is ‘to run through a large property!

22. Utar eya, ulna] He expresses his determination to hold to a
golden mean. He intends to cnjoy his fortune, but he will not he so
elegant as to fecd his freedmen with turbots, or such an epicure us to
know the delicate tusto l‘sahvas') of female thrushes. The intini-
tives depend on the adjectives‚ 111111 verses 5 and o. He advises any
one who hears him 10 live up to his income (1100111111, ‘upto his
harvcst'), and to grind all his grain (that is, not to heard it), because
Hlii easy enough to get another crop. ‘Iu herba' means ‘in the

ae.

27. Ast cocotofficium :] ‘But’ he seems to say, passingfrom the first
to the second person, ‘an emergency may arise which calls upon you to
do more than your income warrants. Thcn don't hesitare to sell some

of your land and draw on your capital) The·supposed case is that .

‘Surda’ means ‘unheard,' ‘to which the gods are deal! For ‘ pictus
in tabula' sce i. 89. The gods ‘de puppe' are the guardians of the
shiphnoltlnecessarily the sameas the παράσημον on the prow (cf. Acts
xxvm. .

33. sai coenam saneris lta-cs] There is an objection to all 11111, from
the thought of what revenge a man's heir may inflict on him after he
is dead. ‘Coena funeris' wus a dinner given to the friends of the de-
ceased after the funeral, quite a different thing from the ‘feralis coena'
leston the tomb for the dead (Juv. v. 85). ‘inodora' is ‘ without per-
fumes,’ which it was customary to sprinkle 011 the ashes. ‘Surdus'
is here used of that which has lost its smell; and in the next verse
‘peccent' means ‘are adulterated! ‘ceraso' may be the gum of the
crerr ·tree.

37.y Thac bono incolumis] The heir is represented as apostrophizing
the dead man, and asking him if he is aot to suffer 101 wastiug his

is doubtful; Orelli thinks that the wine was not nrixed with salt water
(it would appcar that some of the best Greek wines were 1ο mixed).
Mr. Macleane in his note 011 this passage in Persius expresses the
saure opinion ; when he wrote his note on Horace (l. a), he had

⁸ thought that ‘maris expers’ in both places meant that which was of

horne growth and had never crossed the seu. Iam inclined to think
that Mucleane’s later judgrnent as to the passage in Horace is correct ;
but any onc who has noticed the way in which Persius uses words
and phrases from Horace will see that it does not by any means follow
that he meant to use the words here in the sense in which he under·
