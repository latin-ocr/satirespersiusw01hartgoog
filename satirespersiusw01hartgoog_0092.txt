sarran vr. 73

Writing to his friend Bassus, Persius defends his own resolution
to enjoy the good things which he has in the world, aud he advises
all men to do the same, making special sport of those who deny
themselves that they may leave a large estate to their heirs. The
poem is hard to understand, and seems rough and obscure like the
first Satira, so that it requires a good many notes, some of which can
claim to be no nrore than probable conjectures. But l think that
labor spent upon it will not be wasted.

Arsennaria-Has winter sent you, Bassus, to the country, with

ance and envy; Ι do not care if men of lower birth are richer than 1
arn. People differ; one is sparing even on festal days, and another
spends a great fortune on good things t'or his table. l mean to enjoy
what l have without making a glutton οι myself, and to use all my
income, expecting aa nruch again (lu-26). And ιιΙ a friend loses all
that he has, and is in distress, then tbr his sake 1 will take something
from the principal. So you think that my heir will neglect my t'uneral
ritca, if 1 use up part οι my property, and will scold me roundly tor

wisdom, which makes even common people luxuriousl Who cares

listen to me. Caesar is trying to get up a triumph, and is hiring arms

1. Admovit jara humo foco] Bassus, like Horace, would seem ιο have
been in the habitos retiring to the Sabina country for warmth in the
winter. We have but two verses οι his composition; and itis im-
