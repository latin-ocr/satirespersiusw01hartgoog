stood them to be employed by him. It gives a good sense to ren·-
der 'maris expers³ ‘without salt‚' that is, ‘without wit,' ‘insulsum'
(so Heinrich) or ‘corrupt’ l so Jahn) ; but it rather seems to me that
Persius recalled the words with the idea that they denoted something
ol an inferior quality (it is by no means certain whether they do de-
note this or the contrary), and that he used them here in the same
sense, connecting thern in a sort of oxymoron with ‘cum pipere et
palmis'; and Ι should suggest the rendering: ‘this (wretched) wis·
dom of home growth (nostrum) which was imported with pepper and
palms! Ι do not think that Persius meant to make sense; he wished
to ridicule a certain class of critics. Casaubon was ingenious enough
to think that ‘ maris' was the genitive ol 'mas' The poet goes on to
complain that even ordinary laborers put coarse oil into their por-
ridge and so spoil it. In ‘ Haec cinere ulterior metuas‚' Persius drops
the irony, and asks the man it he is such a fool as to be frightened by
the sear of talk like this after he is dead and burned.

41. Atta, mens terea] Persius shows his own mind in the matter,
by telling his heir how he means to observe a day of public rejoicing.
The day selected is that on which Caligula wasto enter the city in
triumph after a pretended victory over the Germans, August 31, ao.
40. Persius was then seven years old, and may have renrcmbered
the scene. l On the whole subject, see Merivale, v. sto-356.) Ac-
cording to the historiens, the emperor marched to the Bitiae, placed
a few captives in a concealed place across the river, caused an alarm
· to be sounded, went out bravely with a small band of attendants,
dispersed the pretended enemy, and sent a laurelled letter (cf. Juv.
iv. 1401 to the senate to announce his victory· lle then gothered a
large army lor the subjugatlon of Britain, marched them to thesea-
shore, and bade them pick up shells to be sent to Rome and deposited
among the treasures ol' the nation. lle ordered a magnificent triumph,
putting the property of all his subjects at the disposal ol his procura·
tors; but finally he entered with only the solemnlty ol an ovation.
‘Seductus' (verse 42) is used as in ii. 4.

44. oris Frigidus excutitur cinis] These are the preparations lor the
celebration. The altars are made ready for new sacrifices: and
Caesonia (Caligula's wife) hires weapons to hang at the temple doors, ‘
aud royal robes, and yellow woollen lorthe captives, and warchariots,
and huge Gauls from the Rhlne. Iunderstand ‘lutea gausapa' of the
dress to be worn by the sham captives; bnt sonte think that it means
‘slmggy auburn beards! ‘Rheni’ seems to be the Greek form, Ῥῆνοι,
lor the Latin ‘Rhenani': or it may be taken to mean pictores or stat·
ues representing the river, which were borne in the procession.
‘Locat' shows the fraud.

4a. centumplum] A hundred pairs of gladiators is his intended
. sacrifice (under the empire this was not a very large number); and
besides he means to give a largess to the people. ‘Artocreas ' is not
found elsewhere; hut its composition (ἄρτος, κρέας) explains itas
a distribution of both bread and meat. Some coll it a kind ot
meatple.
