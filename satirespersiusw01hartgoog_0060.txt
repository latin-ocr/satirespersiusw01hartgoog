sartan 1. 41

119. Men' mutire sethri] ‘Mutire' is tto say mu,' and means to
mutter or speek under the breath. Ovid tells this story oi Midas
antl his ass’s ears. He war so aslramed of theru that he took pains
to hide thern under his turhan. But the barber who cut his hair
found them out. and, being unable to keep the secret to himself, went
and daga holein the earth, into which he whispered it ; then, having
covered the hole, he went away. But reads sprung up over the spot,
and when shaken by the wind betrayed the words ol the barber.
This is what Persius refers to in ‘nec clem nec curu scrobe, nusquam,'
which is his answer to himself.

120. Hictarnen infodiam] This is the same idea continued. He

which he meent to deposit the great secret that he is going to tell.
in the lile of Persius attributed to Suetonius it is said that he wrote
‘Mida rex habet,' aud that his friend Cornutus, aiter his death, erased
‘Mida rex’ and put in ‘quis non,' thinking it better to sngpress so
obvious a reflection on Nero. I arn half inclined to think asaubou
right in editing ‘Mida rex,' though all the MSS. have our present
reading, and though I think the allusion to be, primarily at least, to
liillil‘lllglelliolsslr‘hllileltpl'lftufi‘affl'g'illlirmiillhlli
claimed to he a line poet, would take it to himself. On the other
hand, it seems best to retain ‘quis non,’ because then we have here
the whole of the question which was begun inverse 8, and thus the
secret with which the poet has been laboring comes to light. In either
case, as l look at it, the-meaning is the same. This secret, this joke
ot* his, worthless as it may seem, the poet says he will not barter away
for any Iliad such as he has described above (verses 4, 50).

123. Audaci qwr'crmqae afflare Cratino] The poet goes on to appeal
to those who are familiar with the old comic writers oi Athens, say·
ing that they will read his satiras ; and thus at last he gives a real
answer to ‘Quis leget haeai ’in verse 2. lie joina together Eupolis,
Cratinus, and Aristophanes (cl. Horace, S. i. 4. 1). The latter is
here called ‘praegrandis senex,’ with reference to his antiquity rather
than to his age. ‘Alilais' is put iu the vocative with averh in tha
second person, as in iii. 28, 29. See A. 53. b; M. 299, h, obs. 2; H.
869, 3. 'Fallere' which is commonly used with an accusative, means
to grow pale with the study oi these great satirists. ‘Aliquid decoc-
tiua’ is ‘something more reilned than usual!

126. Inde vaporata} ‘inde' is ‘from thess writers? ‘ Vaporata
aure' is an ear wanned with excitement or pleasure; at least this
seems the best explanation. ‘Ferveat' also expresses the warmth
ol the reader's admiration. Persius takes, therefore, as his model,
not the earlier Roman satirists‚ but the Greek comedians.

127. Non iic] lt is by scholare and studente that he expects to
be read and appreciated; he does not ask lor the attention ol men
who laugh at national peculiarities and personal infirmities, who pride
themselves ou petty honore, aud who nrake apprt oi mathematiciaus
