nounced in one syllable by synizesis. lle tells his heir not to repeat
to him over and over again the advice that fathers give their sous, to
put out their money at interest and live on the income. ‘Foenoris
merces' is used ior the simplas form ‘merces’

68. Quid reliquum estt] 'Phe heir ventures to ask the poet how
much there is left; aud the latter answers indignantiy by expressing
his final determination to enjoy his wealth, and not pinch himself in
order that somebody may live luxuriously on wirnt he has saved.
A man whose festival dinner consisted of nettles and smoked pig's
eheek split through theam, must have been either very poor or v'ery
economical. The Romans fattened the livers os geese (f anseris magni
jecur‚' Juv. v. 114) by leading the birds on flgs, to make what we
call prite‘s de fines praa. ‘Nepos' may be used here in a double sense:
‘a spendthritt grandson!

73. mihi tramafiqarae] ‘'l'rama' is properly the ‘woof,' the threads
which cross the ‘stamen' or ‘warp’ ‘Am 1 to have only a thread
ot' my shape -only the treme ot my body -leit me, while he has a
priest's belly shaking with its fatt’ 'Papa' was the priest's assist·
ant who struck the victim on the head, after which the ‘cultrarius'
cut the throat. These two officere had as their perquisites the parts
of the sacrifices which were not bumed. ‘Popa' is in a kind ot' ap
position with ‘venter,' or it may be said to be used adjectively.
‘Omentum’ is not elsewhere used ior ‘adeps' ‘tat’

75. Vende animam lucra] As lunderstand the poet, he goes ou here
ironically advising his heir to attempt, especially by taking up the
business afa ‘mercator' and slave dealer, to double his wealth. The
man raphes that he has done so, and that it goes on increasiug.
‘Excute' is used in much the same sense as in i. 49. Many slaves

= were brought to llome srom Cappadocia; they were sold from a plat-

fonn called ‘catasta' ‘Rigida' is a redundant epithet. ‘Plausisse'
depends on ‘praestantior ’ς it means ‘to slap' the men on the thigh
or arm or other siuewy part, as the auctioneer would do in order to
show them off. ‘Ruga' is here the iold of the garmeut in which
money was carried, or a money—bag or purse.

78. dapunye utitinam] 'l'he man himself aske the poet to ‘make
amark (stiok apin) where he is to stop '; and the poet replies iu effect
that it is as impossible to tell what is enough for an avaricious man,
as it was for Chrysippus to solve the fallaey ol the ‘sorites’ and tell
when he had grains enough to make a heap. The ‘sorites' (σωρῐτης,
from σωρὸς) was a fallacy oi definition, in which a person was asked,
for instance: “Does one grain make a heapl'' “ Do two graius
mnkeaheapl” “Do three grains make aneapt” and so ou. It
was easy to seem to convict any one of his inability to detine a heap‚
‘finire acervum! Like questions were asked, andare asked by law·
yers nou, to attempt to force people to detine ‘¹ a few‚’' ‘⁴ several” etc.
Chrysippus's rule was to stop answering after a while, ἡσυχάζειν,
