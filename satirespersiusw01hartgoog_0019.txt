was a translator of Menander; and Persius had very
likely read one or both of these authors. Is it not possi-
ble that, not only here but elsewhere, both Horace and
Persius may have borrowed from a common source? At
any rate, it will be very instructive ιο compare the three
forms into which the same nraterials have been cast, first
by the Comedian to make an opening for his play, theu
hythe earlier Satirist to illustrate the insanity of lovers,
and finally by our author to prove that the mere absence
oftemptation does not make a man free. Horace trans-
fers the words of Terence into his hexameters3 but Per-
sius seized upon an idea which he found, worked it over,
and applied it to an entirely different use.

It ought te be noticed, moreover‚ that some of the
words and the ideas of Persius are evidently taken from
virgil, but with a like change of meaning and of applica-
tion asin his imitation of Horace ; ae, for instance, when
Virgil’s words, applied to the study of the powers of nat·
ure:

“Felix‚ qui potuit rerum cognoscere musas?

suggest an exhortation ιο the study of duty as taught by
philosophy:

“ Discite, io miseri, et causas cognoscite rerum.'’ θ

The student will do well ιο observe also how words

and phrases which Juvenal uses so well may sometimes
be traced back ιο his immediate predecessor iu that field
of literature to which he devoted his mighty powers. It
may he that he derived no small part of his inspiration
llom him. “
