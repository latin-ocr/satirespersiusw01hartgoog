the Frogs of Aristophanes (vv. 1431, sqq.) in which Alcibiades is
compared to a lion's whelp. ‘Popellus' is a conternptuous diminu-
tive ol ‘populus’ Anticyra in Phocis was famous os a place from
which helleboro was brought. There was another town oi the same
name on the Maliac guli, but the plural here seems to have only the
idea of exaggeration, as in Horace’s “ tribus Anticyris '' (A. P. 300).
‘Melior sorbere' is equivalent to ‘quern sorbere melius foret!

17. Uncto uixisse patella] The philosopher answers his own ques·
tion. ‘Uncta' is a common epithet ior dainties. Horace uses ‘pelli-
culam curare,' ‘cutem curare,’ for taking care of the body, especially
in the way of eating and drinking. So here we may understand that
the man liked in winter ιο eat his dinner in a roorn which caught the
sun's rays3 or tire idea may be separate lrom the former and refer to
the custom of lying in the sun after being anointed. The Latin word
{pp either would be ‘apricatio’ οι· ‘insolatio' (Compare Juv. xi.

19. Exspecta,· harrd aliu ‘Exspecta’ is ‘walt a moment' He
tells him that Baucis, an odwoman who stands by, could give as
good an snswer as that; ‘haec' is used δεικτικῶς. ‘l nunc' is con-
temptuous: *Νοινν then (atter such an admission), go and boast of
being the son of Dinomache andei your beauty. ero vitares, if you
are no wiser than this ragged hagl’ The mother ol Alcibiades is
mentioned because it was through her that he was connected with
the Alcmaeonidae. For the use of the genitive, see Α. 50, l, b; M.
280, obs. 4. In the next verse, the woman Baucis is described as an
herb-seller, crying out (trying ιο sell) ‘ocima' to a slave oi very loose
character. ‘Ocimunr ' was some sort of herb which is thought to have
been a stimulant. ‘Bene' is used as in i. lll; and ‘discincto’ as
in iii. 31. The woman is acting on the same principle as Alcibiades
-fitpl get alpng with little work, and ιο plesse the people with whom
se asto o.

23. Ut bernoin sese tentat Here, as at verse (53 οἰ the preceding
satire, the scene with whic the poem opened is suddenly brought
ιο an end, and the poet begins to lay down general principles, of which
the preceding verses lurnish sn illustration. ‘ln sese descendere'
means to ‘study one'a own character! Persius has changed the form,
tpough nod the moral, of the old labie, which Phaedrus (iv. 9) puts in η
tesewor s:· '

“Peras imposuit Jupiter noble duas:

There follows an example of the way in which people find all the barm
they can in a man, and do not think of his better qualities.

25, roaesieris, Nostt'n'] The subjunctive is that of supposition ; not,
aa some graminarians put it, of concession. See M. 352; Z. 5le and
notc; lt. 1552. Cures, in the Sabine country, may be mentioned as
suggesting a simple and thrifty ht . The ablatives in verse 27 are
ablatives oi quality. ‘J ugum pertusa ad compita iigit‚' ‘he foetens
