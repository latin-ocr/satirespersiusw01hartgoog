the dangers 01 the broken egg. He says that egga were put by the
priests on the flre to ronst, and 11 one hroke it portended mischiei to
him 101 whom the trial was made, or to his property. There were
various superstitious about eggs, such as that as soon as the inside

used them in their incantatione. '

priestess 01 lsis to whom the ‘sistrum' particularly belonged; with
it this goddess struck bliod those with whom she was angry. The
priestess is therefore called ‘lusca’ She may be supposed to have

SATIRE VI.

Tars Satire has been thought by soma commentatore 10 be only
a fragment; but its ending is 1101 very abrupt 101 Persius; andI
doubt if it was his deliberate intention to add any thing to it. At
the same time, there can he little doubt that, ii it had not been 101
the poet's early death, the Satires would have come down to us in a
more carefully prepared 101111, and would have been rounded aad
smoothed in many ways.
