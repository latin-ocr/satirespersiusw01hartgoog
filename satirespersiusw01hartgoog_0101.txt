JUVENAL (Turnrrnu Sarrana), with Notos, by nno-¹

maun, abridged, with Additions, by Professor Sanoua
Haar, Trinity Collega, Hartford. 16mo. Cloth. alac.

“ Macleane's Commentary has been well known and highly
valued among scholars, but its price has heretofore, for the
most part, kept it out of the reach of our undergradnates.

- Professor Hart’s abridgment has now put into their hands all

that would be of usa to them iu the larger book, the parts
omitted being such as would be of service only to scholars of
more leisure and greater proficiency. This, however, is not all
that the editor has done in preparing this book. He has studied
the editions of Heinrich, of Illayor, and of other commentators,
and has incorporated much that is useful from their notes; and,
in addition, he has inserted notes and commenta of his own„
including many explanatione of peculior construction, and a
considerable body of grammatical references. It seems to us
that no undergraduate‚ who is ready to enter upon the study of
Juvenal, will fail to find in the ample notes contained in this
volume a satisfactory answer to any question that he can expect
to ask as to the meaning of the text.”
