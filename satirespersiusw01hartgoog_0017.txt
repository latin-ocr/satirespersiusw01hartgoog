X INTRODUOTION.

was exercised by Nero in the later years 01 his reign*
and afterwards by Domitian3 but he had learned what
he believed to be the true path 01 1110, choosing the nar-
row way which the right branch 01 1110 Samian letter
pointed out;† and he saw that men about him either did
not know 01 11101 way or did not choose it, and so ran
into errors of judgment (Sat. i.),'into 10100 ideas 011110
gods (Sat. ih), into 11100000 and· shiftlessness (Sat. iii.),
into lack 01 sels-knowledge (Sat. iv.), into wrong notions
01 liberty (Sat. v.)‚· and 1010 stingy avariae (Sat. vi).
Anu, though he had not a ready pen, he felt it his duty
to protest against the errors which were gaining ground,
10 point out the right course 01 1110 and its only noble
end, and thus to do something for the reformation 01 the
times. It is not astonishing that this studiously disposed
youth, not twenty-eight years old, did not know alldepths
of wickedness, and did not hold up every kind of wrong-
doiug to contempt and disgrace. Ι1 could not be expected
that a man with a library 01 seven hundred volumes at
his hand, should get all 1110 ideas 01 1000 and things from
his own observation. Nor· could we ask 01 000 who had
studied Ohrysippus and had been taught by Cornutus,
that he should 110 altogether original 10 1110 methods.
