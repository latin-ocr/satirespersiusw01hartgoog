and the mixed character 011110 metaphora and the uncertainty 01 00100

argument which follows shows what is, in my judgment, the scope
01 1110 00010, 1110 words iu small capitale giving the idea with which
the poet is laboring throughout; and in the notes I have attempted
to trace the connection 01 thought, aud to explain the many hard
words and passages. ln most instanees it did not seenr desirable to
mention other explanatione which have been suggested, even where
it was difficult to decide between them and those which are given;

· he puts into the mouths 01 1110 objector or objectors with whom he
argues. The single inverted commas (¹ 'l are used 101 quotatious 01

It will be especially interesting 10 11110 Satira to note the allusione
to Horace, and to see how verses and parts 01 verses are taken from
him by a kind 01 word-memury, but are so metamorphosed that they
have a meaning very different t'rom that which they originally had.
11 will 0100 be instructive to observa how Juvenal, in imitating
Persius, has borrowed ideas as well as words. But it is beyond the
scope 01111000 notes 10 00101 001 any except the most evident 01 111000

Only sec how men write prose or verse to recite 101011 dress to the
