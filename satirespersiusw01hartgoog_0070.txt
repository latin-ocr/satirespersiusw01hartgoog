they defiled before him on horseback dressed in their robes of state.
The varan, then, would be priding himself on his position as an ‘eques'
Holyduy and tlifford, seeing the same allusion, think that ‘tumn’ is
lemphatic, ipnplying that the man is a relation oi the ccnsar; aad the
atter trans ates:

⁴⁴ And, when the knlsrhts troop by the censur's chalr,
In arinual pomp, sainte a kinsmun there.’'

Helyday¹s version is certainly amusing:

“Thou const salute him by the name of staec,
And arrogantly ask him how he dees.''

Heinrich suggested the reading ‘censorem fatuum! This was adopted
by Macleane, who says that “theman is supposed to be especially
respectful to a censor in his family tree, to whom the poet is not so rc
spectful.’' If the allusion to the knights is retained, as seems necessary, '
the use oi ‘phaleras’ is easily explained. ‘Carry your trappings to
the populace; they may admire theam 1 know what lies under them!
‘Discincti ' is ‘loososs and ‘Natta' is any proiligatc.

32. Sed stipat hic citio] ‘Sed' scetus to introduce something of u
correction, irnplying that Natta’s case is the better of the two. licis
stupid ‘vitio,’ from sonte defcct in his natur·e; he is free from ‘culpa'
afault of conduct or au error ef judgment; he does not know what
virtue is: but the man with whom he is compared knows virtue and
yet forsakes her. Conington forgets the distinction between ‘vitium'
end ‘culpa' and so loses the meaning of the passage. ‘Pingue' is
used as a noun. The idea ef the heart being overgroun with fatis
found in St. uiuat. xiii. iti: ἐπαχύνθη ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦτου. “Νοιιχ
bullit’ means that he sinks so deep that he does not even send a bub-
ble to the top. The metaphor‚ as is not unusual with Persius, is far
frunt consistent.

35. illaque pater divana] This description of thc remerse which they
must feel who abandon virtue, follows naturally, and is very striking.
‘Haud alia' would be regularly followed by ‘quam ut'; the use of
the imperative (in sense) is more forcible. ‘Relicta' is in the ablative
absolate, like Virgil’s ‘⁶ Quaesivit coelo lucem ingemuitque reperta”
(Aen. iv. 692). See Andrews and Stoddard’s Grarnmar, 257, n. 9,
(lt, a. The allusions which follow are to the brazen bull of Phalaris
(‘ gemuerunt' refers, of course, to the gruans of thc victims) and the
swerd of Damocles. ‘Imus Imus ' are the words oi combined remorse
and despair. ‘Intus palleat,' ‘his heart within lrinr, wretched man
that heis, grows palc at the thought of something which the wife of
his bosom cannot know) 'l'he antecedent of ‘quad' is the object oi
‘palleat’ (compare above, verse 3, and v. 184).

44. Saepe acidos, meantia] Persius confesses that when he was young
he did not like to stady, and that he used to rub his eyes with oil that
he might look sick and be excused from declaiming the last speech of

Cato of Utica. ‘Laudanda magistro' is for ‘quae laudaret magister!
