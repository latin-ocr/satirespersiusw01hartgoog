73. Unde Remea] Persius begins to wander off into a praise of the
country after the style 01 poets of his day. He shows how the founders
01 1101110 came from the country, and how the great dictator L. Quin·
tius Cincinnatus was driving the plough when his wife bustled out
, l‘trepida'l to put his robe of office on him, and his lictor took the
plough home. But he catches himself, applauds himself 101 his fine
verses, and returns to his subject. ‘Dentale’ is properly the bearn
01 1110 plough. ‘Dictatorern' is in apposition with ‘te,' which is to be
supplied as the object 01 ‘ induit!

76. Est itanc Brisei] Briseus was a name 01 Dionysus (Bacchus),
which is here applied to the tragic poet Aonius, for some reason which
does not appear. ‘ Venosus 'means ‘shrivclled,' ‘dry,' like the bodies
01 old men whose velus stand out iu the shruulren flesh. Pacuvius
was another poet who wrote (or rather translated 110111 1110 Greek
01 Euripides) the play 01 Antiopa. Persius calls his style ‘warty‚'
‘rough,' and gives a specimen or a parody 01 it: ‘her dolorific heart
shored up on woes' There seems to be no difference here iu the
meaning 01 ‘ est quem' and ‘suut quos!

79. Hos prieris monitus] ‘Such counsels as these ’ means the ad·
vice to follow such models of style. ‘Ne' has alnrost the sense 01
‘uum,' as in J uv. x. 00, with which compare x. 28 ; aud see G. 456,
a. 1; M. 451, a,· Ζ. 302. ‘Sartago’ is a kettle or frying-pan; here
it would seem to have nearly the same meaning as ‘farrago' as 11 11
were a variety 01 things mixed and fried together, a medley 01
speech. And men learned not only to use their language barbar-
ously, but also to applaud the recitation 01 bad poetry, aud that vehe
urently aud to their owu disgrace. ‘Trossulus,' an old name 101 the
Roman knights, had become a nickname, and ‘levis' ‘effeminate’ adds
to the reproach implied in the uoun.

83. Nilne pudet copiti] Next he supposes a man on trial 101 theit.
But even in delending himself the man (he calls him Pedius) must
balance his sentences in polishcd antitheses, and look out 101 applause.
‘Capiti cano' depende on ‘pellere '; the epithet is only throwu 111101·
effect. ‘Tepidum' is ‘luhcwarm,’ and ‘Decenter' is but qualified
praise. ‘Ait' is ‘the prosecutor says! ‘Posuisse laudatur' is
equivalent to ‘laudatur quod posuerit,’ or ‘laudatur eum posuisse.'
Conington calls the infinitive “really the cognate accusative express·
ing the praise received,'' and refers to M. 400. hild G. 528 and a, Z.
00011. 1353. ‘Romule ' 01000010101100000110111011101110101. ‘ Cevere'
is said 01 1110 vilest sort 01 meu: he ashs in indignation whether 110111-
ulus is a man or something viler than vile women that he should
applaud such trash.

88. ilsea’ mouent? qrtr'ppe et] ‘Would he (Pedius) move mel I
suppose, if a shipwreckcd man were to sing me a song, I should take
out an as and give it to himl What, you sing, do you, when you carry
yourselt' about in a picture, floatiug on a bit 01 your wreckl The
mau must tell some talc ot' real sorrow, not made up at night, who
wunts to move me with his story! ‘Incurvasse ² stands 101 1110 shn-
ple word ‘flectere' 'rue sailor aud his begglng picture are referred
to in 101. xiv. 301, sq.
