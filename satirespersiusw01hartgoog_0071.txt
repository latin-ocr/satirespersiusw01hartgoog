‘Sudane' may reier to the heat which the father would bo willing to
endum, or to the pleaeure and excitement which he would feel. Cato’s
last words are familiar to medem school-boys in Dr. Bland'e transla
tion (Spectator, No. 628).

48. „lure etenim'id sumniam] Ile defends himself by saying that it
was natural at that age that hc should care n'rost to play dice, to toss
into a jar, and to whip a top. ‘ Senio,’ ‘the six spot,' was lucky (hence,
‘quid ferret,’ ‘how much it brought in ’); ‘canicula' or ‘cattia' ‘the
ace,' was unlucky (hence, ‘quantum raderet,' ‘how much it lost').
The Romans had two kinds of dice: ‘tesserae' with six marked faces
like our dice, which ecem to be the kind here referred to; and ‘tali,'
marked on four faces (i. iii. iu. vi.) and having two round ends. Three
‘tesserae’ or four ⁴ tali’ were used in a game. With the former, the

⁸ highest throw was three sires, here, probably, called ‘senio '; and the

lowest was three aces, ‘canis' or ‘canicula’ Ii the latter were used,
the highest throw was when all four dice turned up differently ; and
the lowest, when all turned up alike. See ‘ alca' in Andrews's Lex-
ieon. In verse 50, the allusion is to a garne which consisted in trying
to throw nuts or bones or dice into a jar; oi course, the difficulty of
the game would depend on the narrowness of the neck. ⁴ Non fallier’

52. Hand tibi inexpertum] ‘All this,’ the poet seems to say, ‘was
well enough for a boy; but you are too old for euch trifling. You are
not without practice in discerning the straight from the crooked iu
moral character, and in learning the doctrines of the Poreh.' ‘Cur-
vos’ is used in the sense of ‘prauos’ (compare ‘intortos mores‚' v. 38).
The ‘porticus’ is the ποικίλη orda in the Ceramicus atAthens‚ in which
Zeno (and Chrysippus? Hor. S. ii. 3. 44) taught, and from which hie
followers took their name. It was adorned with pointings by Poly-
gnotus, one of which represented the battle of Marathon. The people
whom we call ‘Persians’ are frequently called ‘Medi' by Latin au-
thors. Persius makes the scholare spend their studione and seli deny-
ing life in gazing at this picture.

56. quoe Sarnios diduxit liltore] Samos is said to have been the birth-
place ot' Pythagoras; and ‘the letter which spread ont its Samian
branchos in different directions: is the Υ or Y, which that philosopher
ie said to have need to illustrate the pathos virtue and that of vice
which open before a man when he has passed over the time oi child-
hood. ‘Surgentem'nreane‘steep,'‘arduum.' ·

58. Stertis adina] ‘And yet you snore on! ‘Oscitat hesternum'
is ‘yawns off yesterday' (that is ‘yesterday's debauch’). ‘Passim
sequeris corvos' uray be rendered ‘Are you on a wild-goose chase

62. Hellebornm frustra] The young man whom the poet has been
reproving disappeare from the scene, and Persius now speaks in gen·
