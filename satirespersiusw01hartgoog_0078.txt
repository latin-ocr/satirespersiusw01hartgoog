goes on to entorce and illustrate one of the leading doctrines of the
Stoice: that the wise man alone is free, and that every loolish man
is a slave. lle shows that the legal manumission carmot make any

‘ one truly free ; that men may he enslaved to ignoranceorovarice

or sels-indulgence or love or ambition or superstition. Ile carries on
arguments with a supposed objector, and also introduces other
speakers. If the outline of the poem is kept clearly in mind‚tl1ere
will not be found much obscurity in it, though it requires ample notes
as well as a t'ull argument. There is much true sentiment in the in-
troduction and itis expressed in what seems the poet's natural style;
and there is much vigor in the discussion of the main theme ot the
Satire. The descriptions are good; that of the manumission of a
slave must have been especially amusing to Cornutus, who had gone
through the process himself. This poem abonnds in imitations of
Horace and perhaps of earlier writers; but, though so much ot' it is
horrowed, it has always been highly praised ; and the critias give it
the first rank among the satires of Persius.

Men and their wishes vary. Some give themselves to trade, some
