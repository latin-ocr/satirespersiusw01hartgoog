the reproaches of his friend Polydamas, and ashamed to meet the
men and women of Troy. llere ‘Polydamas et Troiades' mean the
influential classes at Rome, with a hit at the pride of the Romans aa
‘Troiugenaa' and perhaps a satirical reference to their eil'eminacy.
Labeo is said to have been a poor writer who translated the Iliad and
the Odysggy word for word, and to ba the same person aa the ⁴ Accius'
of verse .

5. Non, si qaid turbida Roma Electa] ‘Non ’ is used for ‘ne’ as in
Horace and in post-Augustan prose. See G. 266, a. l; M. 456, obs.
2. ‘Turbida' may be rendered‘muddled.' ‘Elevare'ls ‘to make
light of,' and it serves to introduce the metaplrorof a balance. ‘ 'Pru-
tina' la the common nante of two kinds of balance in use among the
Romans, the scales l‘ libra 'l and the steelyard (⁴ statera'). Here the
former is meant, for ‘examen’ means the. tongue of a pair of scales
which works in the handle. ‘Castigare' is ⁴to correct, and Persius
tells his friend not to waste his time in walking up and correcting the
false index in the scales of public judgment, nor to look for himself out
of himself, that is in the 0 inion of the world.

8. Nom Romaeqais aonVWe need not be at any paine to supply
what Persius meant to say. He meant to say nothing yet, and has
said it very expressively; but he aska his question in full at the end
of the Satire (verse 121). What follows is not more complete or less
unintelligible. ‘Forat Rome who is not-and, ifl may say it-
nay, I may, when l look to our gray lrairs and that ill-tempered life
‘we live, and all we do aller we leave our childish games, taking the
tone of arnelas-then, then pardon me'—‘I will not,' answers the
friend. ‘Then what arn 1 to do? But my spleen is saucy and l am
prone to laugh! ‘Sed' anticipatos the advice his friend would give
him, to hold his tongue. ‘Canities' is used of a premature and dis·
honorable old age, such aa is more fully described later in the satire,
one brought on by idleness and profligacy. ‘Istud' has reference
as usual to what had been said by the other, and shows that ⁴ triste'
means the affected and peevish spirit which might be expected to
criticize the writer. 'l'he use of the infinitiva ‘vivere ’ is in accord-
ance with the nature of that meod, which represents a neuter sub·
stantive. We bave ‘scire tuum ' and ‘ridere meum’ in this Satira
(verses 27,122). Horace baa three instances close together in llp. i. 7.

10. nucibus . . relictis] Nuts wera a common means of amusement
with boys. ‘Nuces relinquere' is quoted as a proverb. lt may be
remembered that Persius was by no means an old man. Horace re·
pcatedly uses ‘patruus' in the sense in ulrich it is employed here, as
we speak of “Dutch uncles.'’ v

12. petralenti splene cachinno] The old writers made tha spleen the
seat of laughter. ‘Cachinna' ‘a laugher,' is formed from ‘cachin-
nus‚' as ‘gluto’ (from ‘glutus’ ‘the tbroat’), ‘popino,' ‘ganea' etc.
'lbe termination expresses one who is addicted to any thing.
