66 ⁸ noras.

86. Mcndose colligis] The poet puts his reply into the mouth of a
clear-headed Stoic (see on verse ⁰3) ; unless perhaps ‘hic’ is used
δεικτικῶς, referring to Persius himself. 'l'he objector has argued (it
is a streak of humor) in a syllogism, using a Stoical definition for his
major premiss. The reply is in logical phrase: ‘Your inierence is
false; 1 deny your minor promise!

88. Vindicta postqtann] The objector reasserts his position, mak-
ing one exception to his power to do as he chooses. ‘Vindicta' is
explained on verse 75; the word is in the instrumenlal ablative.
‘Mens ¹ is ‘my own property) Masurius Sabinus was a J'uriseonsul-
tus of great authority in the time of Tiberius and the three succeed-
ing emperors. ‘Masuri rubrica’ is the law as interpreted by him.
The titles and the first few words of a law were written in red ink;
and from this fact the laws themselves and the commentaries on them
were called ‘rubricae' ‘Vetavit’ for ‘vetnit' is found nowhere
else except in a note of Servius on Virgil.

91. Disce‚· sal ira cadat naso] The poet begins along reply. He
says that if the man wants to know he will tell him, but he must put
off that angry sneer that curis his nose, while he plucks from his
breast the old grandnrothers' nonsense that he has learnt. ‘Veteres
avias' seems to have been a proverbial sort ol' expression. St. Paul
uses in the same way γραώδεις μῦθοι, which we translate “ old wives'
lables,'’ in his first epistle to Timothy liv. 7).

93. Non Praetoris erat] This use of the imperfect is occasionally
found. Here ‘erat’ means that the Praetor has not and never had the
power to instruet fools in the subtle dnties of life, esoteric duties as
the philosophers might call thern, only to be ‘learned iu the schools,
or to teach thern how to use their short life. With the Stoice all
were fools who were not wise after their fashion. ‘Tenuia’ must be
read as a trisyllable.

95. Sarthacant citius caloni] ‘Yon might sooner teach a gawky
canrpslave to play upon the harp' Each soldier had a ‘calo' to
carry his heavy accoutrements. They were chosen therefore ior
their strength, and were the least likely to he fit ior learning the harp.
‘Sambuca’ was an eastern instrument, and the name is supposed to
be llehrew.

98. Publica lex hominnm naturaque] ‘ The law oi nature enforces this
principle, that ignorante should ahstain from attempting what is for-
bidden to its weakness.' ‘Natura’ appears to be explanatory, and
to mean the ‘naturalis ratio,’ which is the foundation oi the ‘publica
lex.’ This last term is not used by the Roman jurists; bnt it seems
to express their ‘jus naturale) The doctrine of a supreme law of
nature, the actual source and ideal standard oi all particular laws,
was characteristic of the Stoics; its Christian exposition may be seen
in Bishop Butler's Sermons. ‘Vetitos' is used for that which the
weakness of man is forbidden, by the unwritten law ot‘ nature, to
attem t.

lod). Diktis helleborum] ‘Suppose you take to mixing medicine
though yon do not know how to regulare the scale.’ Here the reier-
