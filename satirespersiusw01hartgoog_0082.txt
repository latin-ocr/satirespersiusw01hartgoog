sarran v. 63

36. Me tibi supposui :1 This is only ‘I put myself under you’ His
language is very tender. Cornutus received him to his bosom, as
Socrates received his disciples‚ to whomhe usually became much
attached.

37. ¹saliere sollers] That is, ‘imperceptible,' ‘unobserved‚' in its work-
ing. Persius says that when Cornutus took him in hand, ‘the rule
imperceptibly applied straightened his crooked principles! This lan·

brought into subjection by reason, and was anxious (through the judi-
cious treatment of his master) that she should get the victory over
him; and under the hand of the philosopher it was sheped into artistic
features. This is a confusion of metaphora which cannot weh be re
conciled. ‘Vinci laborat¹ meatus nearly the sameas 'vinci cogitur,’
but it doubtless shows also that the pupil's mind cooperated with the
teacher. ‘Artificem' which would naturally go with 'pollice' is given
to ‘vultum' and so gets a passive meaning.

42. epulis decerpere noctes] ‘lJecerpere' here means to ‘steal away';
‘epulis’ is the dative case. ‘Disponimus’ aud ‘unum’ belong ιο both
‘opus'and ‘requiem' The verb ruay be translated ‘we arranged!
The present is used for the metre's sake3 it rel'ers ιο past time.

4⁵. Non equidem hoc dubites] As to ‘equidem’ sec i. 110, n. In
what follows Persius seems to have had in mind llorace’s address to
Maecenas in C. ii. ll. 17. llere the constellatious are both symbolical ι
of concord and of similar fate ; the friends, as the poet puts ia, must
have been born under Libra or Gemini. But neither Horace, ln the
place just referred ιο, nor Persius here professes to know his own
horoscope; they are both talking at modom, and probably neither of
them believed in astrology. lt may be noted, however, that this sci·
ence was much in vogue iu Persius’s time. livery mau’s Parca was
supposed to attend on his birth, and to go with him through life, as
his Genius did. 'l'he business of the Parcae was to executa the decrees
(‘sata 'l of dove. ‘Nata fidelibus’ is ‘ordoiued for faithful friends ';
or, by hypallage, ‘on which faithful ,friends were boru’ Iu point of
fact, Cornutus lived ιο go into exile some years after his pupil had
died an early death. The one was born a stranger aud carne to lionae
a slave, the other was connected with the first familias in the city,
and boasted a long line of noble ancestors. Vevse ab means that dove
was theirs, and under the auspices of his planet they destroyed the
adverse influences of Saturn. The use of ‘quid' (verse alt nray be
compared with that of ‘quis’ in ii. 20. ‘Me tibi temperat' is ‘tempera
me with you,' that is, ‘ilts and joins me ιο you!

52. Mille hornimera species] lle goes on ta show, in contrast to the
uuiou between him aud his friend and to their studies, the diversity
of tastes and feelings to be found in the world. ‘lterum discolor
usus' means ‘various experiences of the world! ‘Velle ¹ is used as a
noun; cf. i. 9. l’epper carne from India to the emporia of syria or
Egypt, where it was shipped for lfome (see belovv, verse 136). ‘au-

gosum ’ is explained by its dry appearance. ‘Mercibus mutiat piper’
