sarran v. 71

think [or did not think] of going back even now, is you had really
got away from her saie, leaving no part of yourself behind) See·
M. 332; G. 597 ; R. 1533. lle means to tell him that the very fact
oi his entertaining the question shows that he was only half in earnest
in what he said before. With ‘hic' begins the poet's reflection, that
here is a sign of true freedom, differing from that so-called liberty
which is given by the lictor's wand.

176. 'Jus labet dle soi palpo] 'Phe poet takes still another ease, and
asks ‘is that cajoling fellow ·‘ sui juris '’ who is led open-mouthed by
ambitiont' A man who was ‘⁴ sui juris '³ was notin the legal power
of another. ‘Palpo ' is anounformedlike ‘cachinno' li. 12), and means
a flatterer, such as one must be who goes about canvassing for votes.
‘Hiantem' expresses the man’s eagerness. ‘Ambitio' is called ‘cre-
tata' because candidates had their togas well whitened with ‘creta'
fuller's earth, from which practice they had their name. Conington
renders ‘Ambitio' ‘the goddess of canvassing.'

17⁷. ijqila et cicer inpare turpe] ‘Vigila' is ‘keep awake‚ be on
the move.' lt is stated that the aediles were wout at the Floralia to
distribute grain to the people. In ‘nostra Floralia' the poet identi-
fies himself ironically with the man of whom he is speaking. 'Phe
Floralia were celebrated in honor of Flora froin the 28th of April
to the td of May inclusive, with much dissipation aud licentiousness.
The old men are called ‘aprici' because they love the suu.

179. At cura Herodis uenere dita] Persius now passes, rather abruptly‚
to another kind of servitude, that of superstition. 'l'he Scholiast says
that ⁴ Herodis dies' means the birthday of Herod the Great, observed
, by his sect the Herodians. Whether this king’s birthday was kept
or not 1 do not believe Persius knew or carad, any more than Horace's
friend knew what he was speaking of when he excused himself on
the seore of the day being the thirtieth sabbath (S. i. 9. 69, “hodie
tricesima sabbata''). The Romans were well acquainted with the
name of Herod, who ruled dudaea in the interest ot' llonre, and whose
party was favorable to the Roman government. illuminations were
held at the ‹lewish i'estivals. Persius speaks of the windows as
anointed with oil, aud the lamps as crowned with violets. ‘Rubrum
catinum' is a dish of red clay; most of the Italian pottery was of
that oolor. 'Phe tunny is said to have been uscd in sacrifices and
caten at the temple. This fish has a large tail, and ‘cauda thunni'
probably refers to all that lios curled around on the plate. ‘Natat'
seems to be used like an “epitheton ornans,’' referring to the fish in
its native clement.

184. Labra moces tacitus] This man at the Jevvish festivals adopts
their way of praying in silence. Persius adds that he stands in awe ,-
of the sabbath, to which he transfers the epithet that belongs to the 3
Jews themselves. He seems to confuse the dewish observaneeS,
probably with the idea that they were all gloomy. ln the following
verses he adds other superstitious which have no evident connection

with those of which he has spoken. As to these superstitious, see
Juvenal vi. 159, 542 ; xiv. 96.
