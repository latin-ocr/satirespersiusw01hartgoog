ans short poem was apparently intended as the author's intro·
duction to the whole volume of his Satires. It is fragmentary in its
form, and has very little connection with any thing which follows;
it is very possible that it was leit unfinished. Persius says that he
is no poet, and he seems to imply that he wrote only because he was
