another prose - something grand for iungs most bouutiihl os breath to
puff aud blow! Here Persius enters upon the subjectos the Satire.
He goes cn to describe a mau recitiug his productione, with his hair
smoothed and trimmed, his toga 110111 cleaned, with his best (birth-
doy) ring on, sitting on a raised smol, his throat weil gargied, aud a
leer in his eye, showing the lewd character oi his composition. ‘Pedo
liber,' like ‘soluta oratio,' means ‘prose' ‘Scilicet haec,’ ‘aud this
forsooth,’ means the result oi all this labor; and ‘tandem' impiies
that it has required much time to produce it. This mon wears a ring
that he reserves ior birthdays, the gayest hoiidays which tue Romans
kept. ‘Piosma' is a gargie or mixture ior sotteuing the throat.
‘Fructus ' is equivaleut to ‘dissolutus' aud ‘patranti' which occurs
nowhere else, probably means ‘wauton'

20. quentas trepidare Titos] He is deseribing the effects oi lasciv·
ious verses upon wauton ears. ‘ingentes Titos ' seems to be an im-
itation oi Horace’s ‘ceisi Ramnes) The Ramnenses, Titienses, and
Luceres were the three centuries of Equites formed by Romulus,
ond as Horace uses the tirst, so Persius here uses the second for the
great peopie iu general, whom he represents as listeniug t0 this flithy
stuff. ‘Hic' may referto the piace of recitatiou, or to the time oi
theapplause. ‘'Prepidare'meaus that they cauuotheepquiet. ‘Cum'
and ‘ut' are equivaleut. ‘Neque more probo' refers to their lewd
gestures, and ‘nec voce serena’ to their ioud applause oi those parts
in particular which were most excitiug.

22. Tun,' ereda] He indignantiy addresses the render of the foul
poetry. ‘Whati you, oid sinuer, turn purveyor ior the ears ot'
othersi' He supposes the mantobe old in vice, it not iu years, and ,
10 write for no other purpose thou to tickle the senses of the profli-
gate. ‘Cute perditus' properly applies to a dropsicai person. Itis
uot meant literaily here, but describes a person puffed out by flattery
and the applausu oi the listeners. 'Phe personui prououn ‘tu' is
omitted here though emphatic, ‘even you’ ‘Ohet' ‘ohe jami'
‘ohe jam satisi’ were common exclamations, aii meaning ‘that’s
'enou h.

241ἐ Quo didicisse, nisi hocsem'nentuu] This is the supposed uuswer
of the poet whom Persius has addressed. ‘ What is the use of 101111-
ing, it' this leaveu aud aii that is born in a man is not 10 burst from
his liver iihe a wiid iig-treet' For the ellipses with ‘quo ’ sce M. 23e;
Z. 7703 (1. 688 and u. ‘Fermentum' is any thing which fermenta
within; here it is the poet's thoughts. 'Phe man is made uncon-
sciously to describe the corruption oi his own mind by his illustratiou.
'rue mixture ot' the metaphors is harsh, but in the style of Persius.
Lust was sup sed to have its seat iu the iiver.

26. En potor seniumqueil Persius repiies: ‘So what you have
studied for is to be fiattered by such people as these! ‘Pallor' aud
‘senium ' rcier here to the severity of a studious face. ‘O mores! '
seems to have been a common exclamation aiter Cicero’s “O tempora,
Omoresi’' Verse 27 is horrowedfrom Lucilius; it is quoted from

Persius by St. Augustiue. On ‘scire tuum ' see above, note on verso
9, and add A. 57, 8, a, G. 423.
