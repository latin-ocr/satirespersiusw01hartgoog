It is well-known that Persius uses many expressions
which prove him to have been a “minute student ’² of
Horace. The learned Casaubon wrote a treatise entitled
“Persiana Horatii Imitati0,’' in which he cited many
passages some of which show the imitation and some do
not, while at the same time he held that to he true in
this case which learned critics had said of the imitation
of Homer by Thucydides: “ He that takes any thing from
another and uses it in his own way, makes what he has
taken his own.‘’ The general truth of Oasaubon’s stato-
ment is evident3 and, as he says, every kind of imitation
can be illustrated from the examples which he has collected. =
Our author's mind is full of the earlier poet’s words and
phrases3 and he constantly uses them or others which
are suggested by them, but often in new senses and for
purposes entirely different srorn those for which they
were first employed. Sometimes Horace furuished but
the form of the verse, as where “Scribimus indocti ”
very probably suggested “ Scribimus inclusi ”3³¹³ some-
times the phrase is his, as in “maris expers '’† and “ an-
gulus ille”;‘‡ and sometimes the idea of a whole passage
is due to 'something which was remembered from the
earlier astitimus in the determination of Chaerestratus
to' brealr'off from his mistress.§ In this last case, how-
ever, ¹Horace‘‹is'himself indebted to Terence, who again,
