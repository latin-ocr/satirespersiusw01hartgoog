44. erisquis aa] Persius speaks again in his own person, and turns
his remarks against the general spirit of the age, without imagining
any special antagonist. ‘Non’ before ‘ego ' is emphatic and closely
connected with it: ‘Iam not the man to shrink from praise.' See Z.
799; Κ. 1403. ‘Exit’ seems to refer to avessel ‘turned out’ bya
potter. ‘Rara avis' is a proverbial expression ; see Juvenal vi. 165,
vii. 202. ‘Tamen’ is resumptive: ‘tt as l was saying,1 do happeu
to turn out any thing pretty good! ‘Fibra' the lower part ot' the
liver, is used lor ‘jecur‚' the seat of all kinds of desire and passion,
as here the desire oi praise.

48. Sed recti finemque extremamque] ‘But I deny that your ‘eugess
‘belle,' are the end and the extreme limit of all that is right!
‘Finem’ is the end (τέλος) to which things tend; ‘extremum ’ is the
farthest point to witich one can goin tlte pursuit ot' any thing. 'l'lre
words oi applause used by the Romans were numerous3 σοφῶς was
the most common. Horace gives three others l A. P. 428), “ clama·
bit enim Pulcrel bene! rectel” and Martial several more (ii. 27),
“effectel graviter! cito! nequiter! euge! beate!’' 'l'he ligure in
‘excute' is taken from the slraking of a suspected person's clothes to
see whether he has any thing secreted in them. The metaphoris fol-
lowed up here by ‘Quid non intus lrabett’ And the poet says that
this applause covers up bad poetry and the verses which rich men
read lo arasites, who do not dare to tell the truth about them.

50. on hie est Ilius Acci] This Accius is thought to be the Labeo
of verse 4. Hellebore was a purging medicine supposed to have
much effect in clearing the brain, and therefore used in madrress and
by poets and other students. ‘Elegidia’ is a Greek diminutive not
elsewhere used inLatin. The third syllable is lengthened. ‘Crudi
proceres' are great people who have not yet· digested their dinners.
‘Dictarunt' means that they did not read but spouted their nonsense
externpore (or. pretending that it was so) t'or the parasites to admira
and the slave to take down. ‘Quicquid denique,' ‘any thing in short,'
means that they did not confine themselves to ‘elegidia' Citrus wood
was in fashion l'or a long time sor couches and tables. It was tha
most expensive oi all sorta.

53. curuum scis perseuerantem] ‘Ponere’ is ‘to put upon tha table‚'
the usual word. The teats (‘ sumen'l of a sow which had lately lit·
tered ior the flrst time wera much prized by epicures. Persius says
to the great man (he imagines one) that he knows how to entertain
parasites and give one of them a shabby cloak when he is cold, aud
thenl ttlssk their opinion, professing to wish to have them tell the truth
canti l. ι
56. {lui potet? Vra dicarat] ‘How can they? Would you like to
have me tell you (the truthll Well then, you are a twaddler‚ you
old bald-pate, with your half yard of iat paunch sticking out before
you! The emphatic pronoun ‘ego' is omitted again as in verse 23.
‘Calvus' is used like‘ canities' in verse 9. ‘Aqualiculus,' the Scho-
liast says, properly means the paunch of a pig. ‘Sesquipes’ is not
used in this independens way elsewhere. It is the proverbial meas·
ure lor long things. ·
