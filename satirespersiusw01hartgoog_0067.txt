SATIRE III.

Tan purpose of this Satira is to enforce the duty of selfdiscipline.
The first halt of 1110 poern is based on the case ol a luxurious and
lazy young man3 whb cannot be persuaded 10 set himself really at
work. The second halt is more general in its iorni, laying down a
noble outline of that which men ought to study, and urging thern to
be wisc in time. The Satire is written in a strong, nervous style, and
0011101111 some passages which will never cease to be quoted. The
description 01 the power of despair and the enumeration ot' the things
which make up the sum ol duty, are unsurpassed. lt is not difficult
to follow cut the connection of thought; and the student will derive
much pleasure 110111 the study of both the matter and the s'tyle os the
poem.
