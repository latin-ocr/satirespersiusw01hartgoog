1. Rem puli tractis t] Socrates is supposed to be addressing Alci-
biades. ‘th populi' is equivalent to ‘rempublicam' The next t'ew
verses alter the second are taken from the dialogue mentioned in the
introduction, in which tlte mother ol the king ol Persia is represented
as wondering ὅτῳ ποτὲ πιστεὺων (‘quo tretus’t tv νῷ ἔχει οὗτος ὁ Ἀλκιβι-
άδης τῷ Ἀρταξέρξῃ διαγωνίζεσθαι The father ol Alcibiades died when
his sou was quite young, and lett him to the care ot' Pericles and his
brother Ariphon, who were both relations of the boy’s mother. The

ex.; G. 704. 1, ex.4; H. ott, ex. 8.

14. Quin tu icitur] Socrates goes on, as il the youth had disclaimed .

all that had been ironically attributed to him : ‘Then why, if you are
only t'air on the suriaco, don't you stop lawning preconiously (before
your time) on the‘flattering populace, when you had better swallow
