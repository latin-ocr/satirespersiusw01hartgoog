has heen thought to be a marginal gloss which has crept into the
text. ‘lloc quod loquor,’ ‘the very speech Iam making is so much
taken from it! Here Luxuria ends her plea.

154. Ea qratd opis l] The poet goes on again. He likens the man
in his dilemmate a fish with two hooks in his mouth; while he strug-
gles to get free of one he is more tirmly held by the other. The only
solution of the man's difficulty is that he must obey them alternately.
‘Ancipiti obsequio’ is like ‘Mars anceps,' and means an obedience
rendered first to one and then to the other. ‘Oberrare’ is ‘to run
away.' ‘Instanti' is ‘threatening.' The example which follows ex·
plains itself. The chain which the dog carries away hinders his run·

nature of true ireodom. The idea of the scene and, to some extent,
the words, are taken from the opening ot the Eunuchus of Terence,
which was itself taken frorn a play of Menander. A comparison of
Persius's imitationes this passage with Horace’s (ln S. ii. 3. 259, sqq.)
will he found very instructive. Parmeno and Phaedria are the name
of the slave and his master in the play. The master begins by say·
ing that he means to put an end to his sorrows and his disgracel'ul
actions at once, hy discording the mistress with whom he has found
himself desperately in love. He bites his nails to the quick l‘cru·
dum unguem Ἰ, and vows that he will not oppose the counsels of his
sober relatives and be a disgrace to them by wastlng his property in
so discreditable a way. ‘Limen' is used, because the lover was shut
out from her house. ¹ Udas ante fores' may refer to a custom which
lovers had of pouring wine on their mistresses' deors, or daubing them
with sweet ointment; or it may be that the door is thought to be wet
with tears or with rain.

ing her feelings. The slave tells him that he is afool, and that if he
goes back she will beat him with her slipper‚ arrd teach him not to fret
and blte his torls. ‘Trepidare' is used to express confusion in varl-
0us ways. ‘Haud mara’ must be joined closely with ‘dicas':
‘Straightway you would say, What then must Iuor ' What follows
is copied closely l'rom Terence; and Horace has copied it as closely.
