92. Sed numeris decor est] It is almost impossible to distribute
satisfactorily the verses whrch follow. Persius seems to begin to
put a det'ence into the mouth of the man who takes the part ot' the
poets ot' the day, and, almost inadvertently, to let the det'ence run
into a sarcastic description 0f their style aud their claime. Saye the
“ interpellator ’': ‘But we have added grace and unity (or lrarurony)
to the crude verse oi our fathers. We have learned to round a verse
with an allusion to Attis or a delphin cleaving thesea, aud to speuk of
stealing a rib from the Apennine. What poor stuli¹ Virgil did write l'
The metaphora in verse 92 are badly mixed, but intelligihle. ‘Clau-
dere versum' (compare Horace S. i. 4. 40) is, as we say, ‘to fall into
verse,' ‘to be expressed in metre’ Attis or Atys was a votary oi
Cybele who was worshipped ou MouutBerecyntus iu Phrygia. His
story is told by Catullus in a poem (Carru. lxiii.) which is “almost un-'
rivalled for the awfulness of its grandeur and the teuderness of its
pathos.'' The delphin which cleaved Nereus may possibly be Arion's
(Herod. i. 245 ;,but verses 94 and 95 either are written in ridicule oi
a vicibus style, or are quoted as examples of it; and is they ever had
any meaning, it is impossible to determine what it was. The man
who is represented as praising these expressions and turns of thought,
goes on to intimate that in his opinion the Aeneid is like a thick-
skinned old hough with the sap oozing out of it (⁶ spumosum 'l which
is dried up with au overgrown bark. At least, this is one way of
understanding his words ς hut they are hardly more iutelligible than
the fine quotations which he has ⁸iust given.

98. arrianam r'pitar teneram] llere Persius speaks again. lle goes
ou to give an example of what might, ou his opponent's principiae,
he called tendet poetry aud read with a lackedaisical air. 'l'he lines
have been attributed to Nero, hut it is uut very probable that he wrote
them. 'Phey may have been taken irem some poet oi the day or written
by Persius l'or the occasion. The subject oi' ⁸ implerunt ' seems te he
indefinite, while ‘ablatura Bassaris' and ‘Maenas flexura’ are united
(in sense) as the subjectat ‘ingeminat’ ; the t'ormer may refer to
Pentheus, whom his mother, Agave, slew, mistaking him for a benst
(here a cali, in Ovid a hear, in Euripides a lion); the latter is de-
scribed as mounting the chariat oi Bacchus, to which lyuxes (else-
where itis tigers) were harnessed with hands of ivy. ‘lteparahilis’
is used actively (compare ⁴ venerabile‚’ duv. xv. 1435.

103. Haecficrent si testiculi] Persius clainrs that such stuff proves
that the men ot' his day had lost their tiithers' nranliness; the verses
are nerveless and fluat on the tougue (that is, they do not come irem
the mind); the man who writes them does not rap his knuckles on
his book-shelf (perhaps here taken for the writingtable) or bite his
uails in perplexity; these tluent triflers are never at a loss.

107. ded qaid opas teneras] 'Phe objector allows that all this is
true, buthe sees no need of rasping tender ears with such hiting truths.
‘Take care it'you will l‘ sis’ == ‘si vis ’),'says he, ‘lest you happen to

treeze to death on sorue great man’s doorstep; you cau hear them
snarling at you! The dog's letter is ‘lt,' aud the idea is taken from
