³1. Ecca ocia 'l'he poet now posses from prayers for wrong things,
to prayers lor oolish and undcsirable things. The first example is
that of the woman who prays that her grandson or nephew may be
rich and lucky. The middle linger tras called ‘ infamis' or ‘famosus'
‘the linger oi scorn.' Marhing a child with spittle on the browand
lips was thought to ward off the influences ot the evil eye (‘urentes
oculos 't There may be an allusion to the ‘ dies lustralis’ on which
inlunts were purified and named, the eighth day of life lor girls. and
the uinth day for boys. ‘ Metuens divum' is a translation of δεισιδαίμων,
a ἦνοῦ media,'’ which may or may not imply contempt (see Acts
xva.“ .

hopclul ’' (hlaclcane), “the pinchcd little hope of the family '¹ ( Coning-
toa); but it seems unnccessary to take ‘spem' in any other than its
usual meaning: ‘in suppliant prayer she extends ber slender hope,
norv to the ficlds of Licinus, now to the palace ol Crassus' The first
ol these men was a wealthy freedman ol «lulius Caesar, the second
was the Μ. Crassus who was killed by the Parthians, and whose
wealth was enorrnous. ‘Hunc rapiant' is ‘let them scramble for him)
‘But,' says the poet, ‘Idon’t trust nurses to make prayers.' ‘Albata'
is ⁸ dressed in white,' as was the custom on solemn occasions.

41. Poscis opem neruis] 'l‘bis is an example oi prayer lor that
which the action of the suppliant himself makes impossible. ‘Esto
age, sed’ is ‘so tar all right, but -.' ‘'lucetum' is said to be a
Gaulish word, and to mean a dish ot beel steeped in a thick gravy.

44. liam statere exaplos caeso bova] Here we have a curious instance
of a soulish prayer - that ot' tho man who prays that he may become
rich, and at the same time offers all that he bas or gets to the gods in
sacrifice, thus del'cating his own wishes. ln the previous case the
prayer of the pctitioncr cannot be granted because he puts an ob
stacle in the way; io that which is given herc, he throws away what
the gods grant, aad thus frustrates their kiudness. The one illus·
trates luxury; the other, waste. ‘Arcessis' is a strong word, expres-
sive here of conlidcnce. ‘Portuno' is invariably applied to the pods3
here ‘Penates’ is the subject, aad ‘me' nray be supplied as the object.
In ‘hic' (verse 48) the third person takes the place ol the second;
for ‘intendit' refers to the sarae person as ‘exoptas’ ‘Fertum’ is a
sort of cake used in sacrifice. 'lbe man’s hopes continue till the last
bit ol money is lcl't to sigh i'orloro at the bottom of the chest. The
figulpe by which the disappointment is attributed to the sestertius is
stru mr:

b “ 'Tls the last shinlog nummus, left hopeless alone,
